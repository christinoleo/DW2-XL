## Guiding Principles
Principly this mod aims to create a better player experience while playing games of Distant Wordls 2.

## Research (Tech Tree)
- Some aspects of the tech tree were simplified or reorganized to make it more logical and intuitive
  - Removes unnecessary dependencies in the tech tree to make it easier to research what you want
    - For example - it is not necessary to research all of the "standard" tech in addition to your racial bonus technology in order to get to some upper level technology.  Rather, yours will either eventually give you that opportunity directly, or it has been extended to give you an equivalent end-game version that is every bit as powerful.
  - Removes all of the research bonus requirements from tech, which gives a more even playing field for all races.
    - For example, the Boskara have a -20% all research malus, which slows them down, but doesn't randomly preclude them from overcoming that with perseverence.
- Moves most of the real decisions about which direction to go in research starting around the third level of tech, instead of the first two levels.
  - This lends itself to starting games where empires have some worlds already, but aren't then gifted a massive volume of tech.  Rather, they have enough to have expanded, but the core decisions about each empire are yet to be encountered, making playing a game with this advanced start more replayable and fun.
- Tech costs scale better as the game progresses
  - giving you an early research period where you're just exploring your local system and its immediate neighbors
  - a middle-game where tech increases apace with empire expansion
  - a late-game where the most envy-worthy techs require a massive empire to obtain and field

## Ship Components
- Provides additional levels of various components
  - This extends some of the decisions you make to be more functional and therefore viable, allowing you to play through using efficent or super powered designs without bumping up against as many of the game-engine's inherent limitations, or without feeling like it's a non-choice because ultiamtely you're forced to choose the one and only one viable approach after a few tech levels anyway.

## Weapons
- Their sizes are normalized
  - Allows more predictable ship designs
  - Gives you the ability to reason about trade-offs between different weapon systems using their many other factors, such as power use, range, alpha-damage v. sustained damage, etc.
  - Offers you and the AIs to design better ships overall
  - Direct fire weapons:
    - Small = 10
    - Medium = 20
    - Large = 40
  - Tracking weapons:
    - Small = 15
    - Medium = 30
    - Large = 60
  - Area and Bombardment weapons:
    - Medium = 25
    - Large = 50
    - Mines = 60

## Fighters and Bombers
- Fighter bays have been nerfed to some degree to keep non-carrier based fleets and ships more competitive (fighter-bombers were just destroying everything in their path after a certain point every single game)
  - You get 1/2 as many craft in each case, but the bays are 20% smaller so consume less space for what they do offer.
- Fighters and bombers have had their cockpit sections nerfed for targeting and countermeasures, to make them less of a perfect killing machine with no possible defense against them.

## Ship Hulls
- Many of the ship classes have been enlarged to offer you more flexibility in designing your ships, playing with some of the more exotic technologies, and generally creating more balanced designs (the AI is helped as well).
- Ship designs have a more natural progression, where first you learn how to field all of the core ship classes shy of capital ships, and then you're given the ability to research advanced variants of those ship classes or expand into capital ships in whatever order works for your empire's growth.
- Overall, ships are bigger in this mod than in vanilla, giving you the ability to load them up with all the fun things you've researched to have the mega battles we're all hoping for!

## Hyper Drives
- Have had the various types extended and balanced a bit so that every path is viable, with obvious trade-offs between lag, in flight speed, and balanced performance

## Reactors
- Have had the various types extended and balanced so that every major type is in-principle viable and competitive, depending on your empire's strategic situation (has enough fuel to feed the engines of destruction)

## Targeting and Countermeasures
- Have been somewhat nerfed to keep these systems from becoming too much of a "win" for high-tech fleets.  They help, they're still critical, but they're not a lock-out against your opponents.

## Colonization
- This tech tree is more freely explorable, not requiring you to research every type of habitat in order to get to the higher levels of technology in those biomes you care about.
  - This should give you and the AIs the ability to make good use out of whatever resources can be found in your region of the galaxy, supplementing tech to make your local area colonizable, rather than needing the perfect map to have a viable and fun game.

## Planetary Facilities
- Maintenance is much reduced to make it possible to not wreck yours (or the AI's) economy.

## Misc
- Technocracy is only available to Ackdarians, as stated in the game's messaging.
