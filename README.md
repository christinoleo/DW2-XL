## Guiding Principles
Principly this mod aims to create a better player experience while playing games of Distant Wordls 2.
It is not a completely different game than vanilla, rather it's "just better" in every way I had time or insight to make something better than it was.  It's the 6 million dollar man version of DW2: The base game, just with more and better and less of that which is annoying.

## Research (Tech Tree)
- Some aspects of the tech tree were simplified or reorganized to make it more logical and reasonable
  - Removes unnecessary dependencies in the tech tree to make it easier to research what you want
    - For example - it is not necessary to research all of the "standard" tech in addition to your racial bonus technology in order to get to some upper level technology.  Rather, yours will either eventually give you that opportunity directly, or it has been extended to give you an equivalent end-game version that is every bit as powerful.
  - Removes all of the research bonus requirements from tech, which gives a more even playing field for all races.
    - For example, the Boskara have a -20% research malus, which slows them down, but doesn't randomly preclude them from overcoming that with perseverence.
- Moves most of the real decisions about which direction to go in research starting around the third level of tech, instead of the first two levels.
  - This lends itself to starting games where empires have some worlds already, but aren't then gifted a massive volume of tech.  Rather, they have enough to have expanded, but the core decisions about each empire are yet to be encountered, making playing a game with this advanced start more replayable and fun.
- Tech costs scale better as the game progresses
  - giving you an early research period where you're just exploring your local system and its immediate neighbors
  - a middle-game where tech increases apace with empire expansion
  - a late-game where the most envy-worthy techs require a massive empire to obtain and field

## Ship Components
- Ship Components have been extended to provide additional levels of various ships systems
  - This extends some of the decisions you make to be more functional and therefore viable, allowing you to play through using efficent or energy hog designs without bumping up against as many of vanilla's arbitrary limitations, or without feeling like it's a non-choice because ultiamtely you're forced to choose the one and only one viable approach after a few tech levels anyway.

## Armor
- Separated out ionic armor from armor-materials
  - Ionic require you to research the base material, and then an additional tech to realize its Ionic enhanced derivative
  - Ionic armors don't upgrade in situ.  Like other armor types, you must refit your ships to gain their advantages.
  - Hence Ionics are a more powerful armor type that you pay for in terms of research and construction, not a weird alternative that plays by different rules.
- Paced out the armor for a more even game progression
- Simplified Boskaran armors to achieve the highest levels of armor without having to re-research the standard ones
  - Also gave them the special facilities at high levels of their research tree so that again, they don't need to also research standard armor to gain access

## Weapons
- Their sizes are normalized
  - Allows more predictable ship designs
  - Gives you the ability to reason about trade-offs between different weapon systems using their many other factors, such as power use, range, alpha-damage v. sustained damage, etc.
  - Offers you and the AIs to design better ships overall (and typically more weapons at any given ship class)
  - Direct fire weapons:
    - Small = 12
    - Medium = 25
    - Large = 50
  - Tracking weapons:
    - Small = 15
    - Medium = 30
    - Large = 60
  - Area and Bombardment weapons:
    - Medium = 25
    - Large = 50
    - Mines = 60

## Fighters and Bombers
- The Fighter and Bomber craft portion of the tech tree has been made more elegant and rational.
- Fighter Bays themselves have been simplified to hold 4/8/16 craft for S/M/L bays.
  - Rather than holding more units as you tech up, they instead simply get faster at replenishing them.
    - The point being to make fighters & bombers a great tool on the battlefield, but not an automatic "I win" button.
  - This also flows


## Ship Hulls
- Many of the ship classes have been enlarged to offer you more flexibility in designing your ships, playing with some of the more exotic technologies, and generally creating more balanced designs (the AI is helped by this change as well).
- Ship designs have a more natural progression, where first you learn how to field all of the core ship classes shy of capital ships, and then you're given the ability to research advanced variants of those ship classes or expand into capital ships in whatever order works for your empire's growth.
- Overall, ships are bigger in this mod than in vanilla, giving you the ability to load them up with all the fun things you've researched to have the mega battles we're all hoping for!

## Hyper Drives
- Have had the various types extended and balanced a bit so that every path is viable, with obvious trade-offs between lag, in flight speed, and balanced performance

## Reactors
- Have had the various types extended and balanced so that every major type is in-principle viable and competitive, depending on your empire's strategic situation (has enough fuel to feed the engines of destruction)

## Targeting and Countermeasures
- Have been somewhat nerfed to keep these systems from becoming too much of a "win" for high-tech fleets.  They help, they're still critical, but they're not a lock-out against your opponents.

## Colonization
- This tech tree is more freely explorable, not requiring you to research every type of habitat in order to get to the higher levels of technology in those biomes you care about.
  - This should give you and the AIs the ability to make good use out of whatever resources can be found in your region of the galaxy, supplementing tech to make your local area colonizable, rather than needing the perfect map to have a viable and fun game.

## Planetary Facilities
- Maintenance is much reduced to make it possible to not wreck yours (or the AI's) economy.
  - At some point I will probably increase these costs, but nowhere near what they were in vanilla.

## Misc
- Technocracy is only available to Ackdarians, as stated in the game's messaging.
- Experimental Warp Fields allow for nearby exploration - more functinoal than the base game, making for a more gradual early game.
