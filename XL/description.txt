To use this mod:
[olist]
[*]You must be on Steam
[*]You must select the current public beta in game properties in steam
[*]Go to the steam workshop for DW2 and subscribe to XL
[*]Launch DW2
[*]Within the game, In the Modifications menu, enable XL
[*]Exit DW2 (Critical - this won't be needed soon, but for now, please do this)
[*]Start DW2 again...
[*]To verify it's working - start a new game with visible tech tree - and look at the tech tree to see that it's clearly not vanilla
[*]Now you can return to the main menu, and start a new game with whatever settings you want for your actual game
