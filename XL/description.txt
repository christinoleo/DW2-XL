To use this mod:
[olist]
[*]You must be using the current public beta (Steam: Game Properties, Betas)
[*]Steam: subscribe to XL in steam workshop
[*]GoG: download XL from github, and copy its XL folder such that you end up with a dw2/mods/XL folder
[*]Launch DW2
[*]Within the game, In the Modifications menu, enable XL
[*]To verify it's working - start a new game with visible tech tree - and look at the tech tree to see that it's clearly not vanilla
[*]Now you can return to the main menu, and start a new game with whatever settings you want for your actual game
[*]Mods are embedded into your game save - so you cannot update or change mods except by starting a new game after making such changes
